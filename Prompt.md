#  Kanban Board 

During development of this React + Vite Kanban Board project, AI tools were used for guidance and problem-solving.

## Areas Where AI Help Was Taken

- Implementing Drag & Drop between columns
- Adding Priority feature (High / Medium / Low with color badges)
- Integrating LocalStorage for data persistence
- Creating Edit Task functionality
- Adding Delete confirmation modal
- Implementing Dark / Light mode toggle
- Search & Filter feature
- Improving UI and animations
- Debugging build and deployment errors (Vercel)

AI was mainly used to:
- Understand complex logic
- Fix errors
- Improve component structure
- Optimize state management

All solutions were reviewed, modified, and implemented manually according to project requirements.
